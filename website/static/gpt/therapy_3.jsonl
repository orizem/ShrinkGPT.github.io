He introduces his current situation—he's 38 years old, married with three young children, and works as a project manager. The primary issue he raises is the growing tension between him and his wife, including frequent arguments, which have become more visible to their children. David is feeling exhausted and overwhelmed by his responsibilities at work and home, which has led to a breakdown in communication with his wife. He mentions that their relationship feels more like a partnership focused on managing the kids and household rather than the connection they once had. David expresses a desire to avoid divorce and fears that the situation may be irreparable, even though he still deeply cares about his wife and misses the connection they once shared."}, {"role": "therapist", "content": "\"Hello, David.

The therapist helps David process his feelings of helplessness and his growing recognition that things might not return to how they once were. They discuss the importance of shifting some focus back to David’s own needs and well-being, as he realizes that he’s lost sight of himself in the effort to fix the relationship. David decides to reconnect with an old hobby, working on his car, as a way to ground himself and regain a sense of joy outside of his roles as a husband and father.

My mom left the house that night, and I remember sitting on the stairs, feeling like it was my fault because I couldn\u2019t keep them together.\""}, {"role": "therapist", "content": "[his tone compassionate, but firm] \"David, that moment sounds incredibly painful, but I want you to recognize something\u2014what happened that night wasn\u2019t your fault. You were a child, trying to manage something far beyond your control. The belief that it was your job to hold your family together, to keep them from breaking, wasn\u2019t fair to you, and it\u2019s not fair to you now.\""}, {"role": "patient", "content": "[his eyes filling with tears] \"But I felt like it was my responsibility. If I wasn\u2019t the one keeping everything calm, who would?\""}, {"role": "therapist", "content": "[softly] \"That\u2019s the weight you\u2019ve carried with you all these years\u2014the belief that you\u2019re the one who has to keep everything from falling apart.

It\u2019s not to be the one who carries the entire emotional burden of the family. You can be there for Sarah and the kids, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to fix every problem or absorb everyone\u2019s stress. What would it look like for you to let go of that responsibility and allow yourself to simply be present, without the need to fix or control?\""}, {"role": "patient", "content": "[pausing, his voice softer] \"I think it would feel lighter, like I could just be with them, instead of always worrying about whether I\u2019m doing enough.\""}, {"role": "therapist", "content": "\"That\u2019s a powerful shift, David. Letting go of the belief that you have to hold everything together opens up space for real connection\u2014where you\u2019re not driven by the fear of failure but by the desire to simply be with your family, as you are.\""}, {"role": "therapist", "content": "\"Sarah, I know that for you, there\u2019s also been this feeling of having to keep things together emotionally. You\u2019ve mentioned before that you\u2019ve been carrying a lot of the emotional load in the family, especially with the kids.

But at the same time, I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ve been doing the same thing in a different way\u2014trying to manage the kids\u2019 emotions, keep the house running, and make sure everyone is okay. And sometimes, I\u2019ve felt like David wasn\u2019t seeing that or acknowledging how much I\u2019ve been carrying.\""}, {"role": "therapist", "content": "[nodding] \"You\u2019ve both been trying to carry so much, but in different ways\u2014David trying to fix things, and you trying to hold the emotional stability of the family.

My dad was gone a lot for work, and my mom was emotionally volatile. I was the oldest, so I was the one who had to make sure my younger siblings were okay. I guess I learned early on that if I didn\u2019t keep things steady, no one else would.\""}, {"role": "therapist", "content": "\"So you became the emotional anchor for your family, much like David became the fixer.

I\u2019ve been so used to managing everything that the idea of letting go feels unnatural. But I can see that it\u2019s not sustainable. I need to trust David more, and I need to give myself permission to not have it all together all the time.\""}, {"role": "therapist", "content": "\"That\u2019s a crucial realization, Sarah.
