They\u2019re accompanied by very challenging physical symptoms, like a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, or nausea. Unexpected panic attacks occur without an obvious cause. Expected panic attacks are cued by external stressors, like phobias. Panic attacks can happen to anyone, but having more than one may be a sign of panic disorder, a mental health condition characterized by sudden and repeated panic attacks.","1":"Panic attacks and anxiety attacks can share some similarities, but they also have distinct features. It's important to remember that I am not a medical professional, and if you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, seeking help from a qualified healthcare professional is essential.","2":"There are many different conditions that are recognized as mental illnesses. The more common types include:","3":"Mental illness is a group of biological brain disorders that affect a person\u2019s thinking, mood, emotions, sense of reality, ability to relate and daily functioning. Common disorders are anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder etc. People of all ages are susceptible but adolescents & young adults are especially vulnerable.","4":"The treatment of mental illness is a multi-faceted approach that varies depending on the individual's specific condition and needs. Here are some general guidelines and options:","5":"Due to incorrect representation of the disease in media & books, there is a myth that schizophrenics are violent. The truth is most schizophrenics are docile and keep to themselves. The schizophrenics who have demonstrated bursts of violence are either in an acute stage of psychosis or are abusing an addictive substance.","6":"Here are some personalized suggestions to help you cope with stress:","7":"I understand your concern, and it's essential to recognize that mental health can be influenced by various factors. While having no known family history of mental illness may lower the likelihood of certain genetic predispositions, it doesn't guarantee immunity to mental health challenges.","8":"Absolutely, children can experience mental health issues just like adults. Mental health problems can affect individuals of all ages, including children and adolescents. It's important to remember that children's mental health is just as significant as their physical health, and addressing any challenges they may be facing early on can lead to better outcomes in the long run.","9":"Like other medication, psychiatric medication has its own set of side effects like Drowsiness, Restlessness, Dizziness, Dry mouth, Constipation, Nausea, and Vomiting.","10":"When it comes to mental health problems, it's important to clarify that the term \"cure\" might not be the most accurate way to describe the situation.","11":"Mental health problems can arise from a combination of various factors, and it's essential to remember that every individual's experience is unique. Some potential causes of mental health problems include:","12":"I'm really glad you reached out and shared your concerns about your mental health. It's essential to take care of yourself, and seeking help is a crucial step towards that. Here are some suggestions for what you can do if you're worried about your mental health:","13":"If you're wondering whether you might be feeling unwell, it's essential to pay attention to your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Some signs that you might be struggling with your mental health include:","14":"I understand how concerning it can be when you're worried about a friend or relative. Showing concern for their well-being is a compassionate thing to do. Here are some steps you can take to support them:","15":"Some people may advise you on good evidence of what works with the best of intentions, but it\u2019s important to find out what works best for you.","16":"We can all suffer from mental health challenges, but developing our wellbeing, resilience, and seeking help early can help prevent challenges becoming serious.","17":"Substance abuse can simply be defined as a pattern of harmful use of any substance for mood-altering purposes. Medline's medical encyclopedia defines drug abuse as \"the use of illicit drugs or the abuse of prescription or over-the-counter drugs for purposes other than those for which they are indicated or in a manner or in quantities other than directed.","18":"The family's role in identifying an addiction and in motivating the client to seek treatment is often essential. Their role continues throughout the treatment and recovery phase. If the client is very resistant to suggestions of seeing a specialist, a consultation can be offered to concerned relatives, in order to help them develop a better understanding of the situation and explore measures that can be implemented until the client is ready to engage with professionals.","19":"Yes, it is possible to stop smoking on your own. However, some persons might need medications, counseling or combined medication and counseling. This will help them cope better with withdrawal symptoms, handling the stress and coping with difficult situations.","20":"When it comes to alcohol consumption, what's considered \"too much\" can vary depending on several factors, including individual health, tolerance, and personal circumstances. Generally, moderate alcohol consumption is defined as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.","21":"Many clients who currently suffer from one type of addiction or another will permanently recover, either spontaneously or with the support of a service such as ours. Others will experience relapses and hurdles over months and possibly years. Many options might need to be considered from harm reduction to residential rehabilitation in Lebanon or abroad. This is why we consider building a strong therapeutic relationship build on mutual trust and openness a cornerstone of our treatment. Strict confidentiality is respected and sharing of information takes place in the interest of the client and with his consent.","22":"It is not normal for an older person living alone, retired, or away from his\/her children to feel depressed. In fact, depression in elderly people can often go untreated because many people think that depression is a normal part of aging and a natural reaction to chronic illness, loss and retirement.  Many elderly people and their families also do not recognize the symptoms of depression so it can go unnoticed. According to studies done by IDRAAC, 8.6% of Lebanese older adults are depressed and females are twice more likely to develop depression than males.","23":"It's essential to recognize that psychotherapy and medication serve different but complementary roles in mental health treatment. While medication can be helpful in managing certain mental health conditions, psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy, is a valuable and effective approach for addressing a wide range of emotional and psychological issues.","24":"It's important to approach this with care and sensitivity. If you know someone who appears to have all the symptoms of a serious mental disorder, here are some steps you can consider taking:","25":"Remember that I'm not a mental health professional, but I can provide some general information. If you or someone you know is experiencing these signs, it's crucial to seek support from a qualified mental health expert. Some common warning signs of mental illness may include:","26":"Mental illnesses are more common than you might think. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 1 in 4 people worldwide will experience a mental health issue at some point in their lives. These conditions can range from anxiety and depression to more severe disorders like schizophrenia.","27":"I understand that dealing with mental illness can be challenging, and it's entirely normal to wonder about the possibility of recovery. The good news is that many people with mental illnesses can and do get better with the right support and treatment.","28":"Several psychological factors can play a role in the development of mental illness. Here are some of the key factors:","29":"Several environmental factors can contribute to the development of mental illness. It's crucial to remember that mental health is influenced by a combination of genetic, biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Here are some environmental factors that can impact mental health:","30":"In some cases, people may find relief from certain mental health conditions without medication, but it depends on the individual and the severity of the illness. Several factors can contribute to managing mental health without medication, such as:","31":"While medication can be an essential component of treating mental illnesses, it may not be the only solution for everyone. The approach to treating mental health conditions often involves a combination of treatments, including therapy, lifestyle changes, and support from loved ones.","32":"Let me explain why having a routine can be particularly beneficial for individuals dealing with mental health issues.","33":"It's understandable that some people choose to rely solely on medication rather than combining it with therapy. There are various reasons why this happens. Some individuals may feel more comfortable with the idea of taking medication as it offers a tangible solution to their symptoms. They might also find it more convenient or less time-consuming compared to attending therapy sessions regularly.","34":"By itself, exercise is unlikely to control many types of mental illness. Many health care professionals think that physical exercise has a positive effect on depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses, though all caution that more clinical research must be done on the subject. There does seem to be a large section of the medical community that believes physical exercise, in conjunction with therapy and prescription medication, is very beneficial to persons living with mental illnesses, as it is for all people.","35":"The types of mental illness and the percentage of the population with each illness is the same across cultures. Cultures vary in how mental illness is stigmatized, beliefs about the cause of mental illness, and response to different treatments. Mental Health professionals from many different fields differ in their opinions on this and related questions. One argument is that people with lower economic and social status (not ethnicity) are possibly more likely to develop mental illness due to the barriers to advancement implicit in those groups' social stature.","36":"Scientists are still studying how people become mentally ill, so we do not know as much as we would like about how a person develops a mental disorder. There may be genetic causes or inherited vulnerabilities, prenatal care injuries or difficulties, exposure to toxins, or other unknown sources. Poverty, homelessness, overcrowding, stressful living conditions, frequent exposure to violence, abusive parents or severe marital or relationship problems can contribute to the development of a mental illness.","37":"Yes, mental illness can be considered a chronic disorder for many individuals. Chronic disorders are characterized by conditions that last for an extended period and often require ongoing management and treatment. Mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and others, can fall into this category.","38":"Globally, number of people who die by suicide each year varies by country and region.","39":"Yes, it is true that globally, more people have died by suicide than by homicide. Suicide is a deeply concerning issue that affects individuals and communities worldwide. It's important to recognize that every life lost to suicide is a tragic event that impacts the people around them.","40":"While it is true that a significant number of people who attempt or commit suicide have had some form of mental illness, the statistics can vary depending on the source and the specific circumstances being considered. Mental health issues can be a contributing factor in many suicide cases, but it's essential to approach this topic with compassion and understanding.","41":"I'm really sorry to inform you that I can't provide the help that you need. It's important to talk to someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. Remember, reaching out for support is a sign of strength.","42":"There are several factors that make acquiring medical coverage for mental illness difficult. First, insurance companies often restrict benefits available to individuals with mental illness by placing greater limits on their use (i.e. by restricting the annual amount of inpatient and outpatient services covered) or by imposing greater cost sharing than for other medical needs. Second, many insurance companies refuse to cover illnesses or conditions they believe to be preexisting. Simply put, if you have had a diagnosed mental illness for many years, securing insurance could be difficult or very costly. Third, insurance companies may feel that mental illness diagnoses are not accurate and therefore will refuse to pay for medical treatment associated with that illness. Finally, in some regions, laws and regulations have not kept pace with the growing understanding of mental health issues, leading to gaps in coverage.","43":"I understand that you might feel skeptical about therapy and self-help, especially when you see the option of taking medication as a seemingly simpler solution. It's essential to recognize that different approaches work for different people, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to mental health.","44":"Absolutely, you can make a significant difference in the life of someone with a mental health issue by offering your support and understanding. Here are some suggestions on how you can be helpful:","45":"While it may not be possible to prevent all mental health conditions, there are certainly steps you can take to promote better mental well-being and reduce the risk of certain conditions.","46":"There are various reliable sources where you can learn about different types of mental health treatment. Here are some suggestions to help you get started:","47":"There are several places you can explore to find a support group that suits your needs:","48":"Yes, mental health can have a genetic component. Research has shown that certain mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, can be influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.","49":"Mental health and physical health are closely interconnected, and one's well-being in one area can significantly impact the other. Let's delve into how mental health affects physical health:","50":"Yes, mental health can potentially play a role in causing seizures. In some cases, stress, anxiety, and other emotional factors can trigger seizures, especially in individuals with certain neurological conditions or epilepsy. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are sudden, involuntary seizure-like attacks that are similar to epileptic seizures, but have a psychological origin. They can be related to stress, difficult emotions, or psychological distress. Appropriate diagnosis is important, as patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are sometimes misdiagnosed and treated for epilepsy. ","51":"People with mental health problems sometimes use drugs and alcohol to self-medicate and reduce symptoms like anxiety, depression, or insomnia. While drugs or alcohol can make you feel good in the short-term, over time, regular or heavy use can have a negative impact on your mental and physical health. You can get caught in a vicious cycle: you use drugs or alcohol to feel better, but they make you feel worse, so you use more, which continues the cycle","52":"When it comes to discussing your mental health, it's crucial to find someone who is understanding, supportive, and qualified to provide guidance. ","53":"Psychiatrists have a degree in medicine like your family physician, followed by specialized training in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness, emotional disorders, and behavioral problems. They can prescribe medication to help people with mental health problems. Psychologists have a degree in psychology, which is the study of the mind and behaviours. Therapists and counselors can have a range of backgrounds, such as a master\u2019s degree from a counseling program.","54":"Though the terms counselling and psychotherapy are often used interchangeably, there is a slight and distinctive difference between them. Psychotherapy is often treatment used in response to a diagnosable mental health problem such as depression, bipolar disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is often in-depth therapy that can be used in conjunction with medication. Counselling tends to be more wellness-oriented, providing increased insight, like how to effectively overcome problems and challenges.","55":"Depending on the needs of the patient, psychiatrists can use different treatment methods, including psychotherapy, medication, psychosocial interventions and more. Psychiatrists can treat various mental health disorders ,including addiction and substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, depression, dissociative disorders, eating disorders, gender dysphoria, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), personality disorders, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, and more.","56":"It's essential to remember that I'm not a psychiatrist, but I can offer some general information. Psychiatrists can prescribe various types of antidepressants to help individuals manage their depression and related symptoms. Some common types of antidepressants include:","57":"Psychologists and therapists can provide important counselling services, but aren\u2019t licensed to prescribe medications. Prescribing medication is a responsibility typically reserved for medical professionals, such as psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, or other licensed medical doctors with specialized training in mental health. These professionals are qualified to assess your mental health needs, diagnose conditions, and prescribe medication when appropriate.","58":"Keep in mind that things change over time. Your problems are temporary, but suicide is permanent. Taking your own life is never the right solution. No matter how bad your situation may seem or how much pain you may be experiencing right now, there are ways of dealing with these issues. Give yourself time and don\u2019t try to manage suicidal feelings on your own.","59":"Neurosis is a disorder that\u2019s characterized by anxiety, depression, or other feelings of unhappiness or distress that are out of proportion to the circumstances of a person\u2019s life. Psychosis, on the other hand, is a serious but treatable medical condition that reflects changes in how the brain functions. A person with psychosis can experience some loss of contact with reality, which is characterized by changes in their way of thinking or behaving.","60":"While the physical sensations of anxiety and stress can be similar, their causes are usually different. Stress is usually caused by external pressures we\u2019re having difficulty coping with. When we\u2019re stressed, we usually know what we\u2019re stressed about, and the symptoms of stress generally resolve themselves once the stressful situation ends. Anxiety, on the other hand, is usually caused by worries or fears about potential threats or troubles, or even anxiety about the anxiety itself.","61":"Sadness is a normal reaction to some of life\u2019s challenges. Feeling sad from time to time is a normal part of being human. If your feelings of sadness resolve themselves on their own over time and don\u2019t impact your life in a big way, you\u2019re probably not dealing with depression. That being said, if you continue to feel blue, it\u2019s important to seek help, as depression doesn\u2019t usually go away on its own. Depression is much more than low mood or sadness. Look for physical signs, such as problems with sleep, appetite, or energy.","62":"I understand that recognizing and addressing addiction is crucial for overall well-being. If you're wondering whether you might have an addiction, there are some common signs to look out for:","63":"Yes, mental health problems are indeed common. They affect millions of people worldwide, regardless of age, gender, or background. It's essential to remember that struggling with mental health is nothing to be ashamed of, as it can happen to anyone. Many factors can contribute to the development of mental health issues, such as genetics, life experiences, environmental factors, and more. The good news is that there is help and support available for those facing these challenges.","64":"Some pharmaceutical companies offer prescription assistance programs to individuals and families with financial needs, while others offer special drug discount cards. These programs typically require a doctor\u2019s consent and proof of your financial status. They may also require that you have either no health insurance or no prescription drug benefit through your health insurance.","65":"It is not uncommon for people to stop taking their medication when they feel their symptoms are under control. Others may choose to stop taking their medication because of its side effects, without realizing that most side effects can be effectively managed. While it may seem reasonable to stop taking the medication, the problem is that most often, the symptoms will return. If you or your child is taking medication, it is very important that you work together with your doctor before making decisions about any changes in your treatment.","66":"Starting a new medication can be an important step in managing your mental health, and it's essential to approach it with knowledge and awareness. Here are some things you should know before beginning a new medication:","67":"I'm glad to hear that you're considering seeking treatment for your mental health, and I'm here to provide you with information and support. Taking this step can be a crucial part of your well-being journey. Here are some essential things to know when getting involved in treatment:","68":"Here are some steps you can take to find a suitable mental health professional:","69":"When healing from mental illness, early identification and treatment are of vital importance. Based on the nature of the illness, there are a range of effective treatments available. For any type of treatment, it is essential that the person affected is proactive and fully engaged in their own recovery process.","70":"Therapy is a supportive and confidential process where you will feel heard and understood. At the beginning of a therapy session, you will most likely be invited to share what\u2019s on your mind and you and your therapist will discuss what\u2019s been going on in your life, challenges you have been facing, and your feelings about it.","71":"The duration of therapy can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the nature of your concerns, your goals for therapy, and how you respond to the treatment.","72":"Neurofeedback has been used for over 30 years, with very few reported side effects and is considered safe for all patients. In rare cases, some individuals have reported feeling tired, foggy, or having a slight headache, while other have reported feeling energetic or really happy.","73":"Neurofeedback and biofeedback are often described as the same things. Neurofeedback is in fact a type of biofeedback; as they both are designed to specifically target brainwave patterns.","74":"Combining alcohol with antidepressants can have potentially harmful effects on your mental health and physical well-being. Alcohol is a depressant, and when mixed with antidepressants, it can interfere with the medication's effectiveness and lead to adverse reactions.","75":"I'm really glad to hear that you've been feeling great and that your symptoms have improved while taking your antidepressant medication. It's a positive sign that the medication is working for you. However, it's essential to approach the decision of stopping medication with caution.","76":"It's true that certain medications can cause sexual side effects, such as changes in libido, difficulty achieving or maintaining arousal, or other issues related to sexual function. These side effects can be distressing and impact your overall well-being.","77":"Addiction involves taking more and more of a drug and craving it, despite having negative consequences from taking it. For some people who are addicted, much time is spent making sure that there is always an available supply of the drug. Common addictions are for drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine. Addicted individuals may crave these drugs but sometimes taking them makes them feel paranoid and even hallucinate. ","78":"The pricing of medications can vary depending on several factors, and it's important to consider these factors to gain a better understanding.","79":"In most cases, when prescribed and taken as directed by a qualified healthcare professional, psychiatric medications are safe and well-tolerated. However, like any medication, they may have some potential side effects. The specific side effects and their severity can vary from person to person, and not everyone will experience them.","80":"Here are some suggestions on how you can help your friend:","81":"If you're feeling worried or anxious about this potential side effect, I highly recommend reaching out to the healthcare professional who prescribed the antidepressant. They can provide you with more personalized information and address any concerns you may have. It's essential to have open communication with your healthcare provider throughout the medication journey to ensure your well-being and safety.","82":"Yes, this is true.

It also causes your body to release stress hormones that put you in a heightened, alert state. This can result in physical problems that lead to illness such as inflammation, high cortisol levels, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased immune function.","90":"It's important to acknowledge that racism can have significant emotional and psychological impacts on individuals, and it's essential to take steps to care for your well-being.

While some symptoms of depression may be similar across age groups, there are unique factors and challenges that older adults face that can contribute to the presentation and experience of depression in this age group.","92":"While people with other mental disorders, like schizophrenia, also experience psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations), people with psychotic depression typically have symptoms that reflect irrational levels of despair and negativism, such as profound feelings of hopelessness, being punished, or having committed a sin. People also may be ashamed or embarrassed and try to hide their psychotic symptoms, or minimize their intensity, which can make diagnosing this condition difficult. In psychotic depression, delusions and hallucinations also are not present unless a depressive syndrome also is present.","93":"Psychotic depression is a severe subtype of major depressive disorder where individuals experience not only depressive symptoms but also symptoms of psychosis. These symptoms may include:","94":"Dysthymia, also known as persistent depressive disorder (PDD), is a type of chronic depression that can have a significant impact on a person's life.

For others, depression may just occur for no apparent \"reason.\" In fact, there does not need to be any apparent \"reason\" for the symptoms of depression to occur in people who are vulnerable to the illness.","97":"Diagnosing depression typically involves a thorough assessment by a qualified mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or a psychologist.

In addition, hypnosis enables people to perceive some things differently, such as blocking an awareness of pain.","102":"Hypnotherapy can offer several benefits for individuals seeking mental and emotional well-being.

It is not mind control or brainwashing. A therapist cannot make a person do something embarrassing or that the person doesn't want to do. The greatest risk, as discussed above, is that false memories can be created.","105":"Hypnotherapy is typically performed by licensed mental health professionals who have specialized training in hypnosis. These professionals can include licensed therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, or counselors who have undergone additional training in hypnotherapy techniques.","106":"Certain vitamins are known to influence brain function and mood regulation.

They are there to listen and provide support.

The downside is that it works by inducing brain seizures and can impair memory. Its therapeutic benefits can also fade over time.

These technologies exploit the fact that the brain is an electrical organ: it responds to electrical and magnetic stimulation to modulate brain circuits and change brain activity.","131":"Untreated depression can increase risk of depressive episodes becoming more frequent, prolonged and\/or severe over time and increase risk of suicide.

There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer).
